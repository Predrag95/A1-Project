# A1-Project

HI DEVS FROM A1! Please read bellow.

Considering I had less than 4 days to create this project I did a pretty good job BUT if I had ONE more day to FINISH the rest of the code that would be great!

It's responsive but still not perfect. Didn't have enough time to add some cool animations... burger menu...

Footer is not properly centered...

Slider is not complited but it does work... (Didn't have enough time to play with images and arrows) 


I know that I'm able to do MUCH BETTER than this but that's what I was able to do in this short period of time.



I would LOVE to have a more detailed talk with developers from A1 and explain to them my code... possible solutions and things I wanted to add to this project.


I hope you will appreciate what I managed to do in this short period of time, thank you!
